# CIS-25-Project

## Overview
This was my final project for my CIS 25 (C++) class at Laney College for Professor Nguyen.

This project contains definitions for Fraction, Point, Rectangle, and Circle classes. It also contains a Utility class which functions as a menu to create and manipulate these objects.

This code was written in 2016.
